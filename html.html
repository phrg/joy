            <h1>Social Change Project: Joy and Happiness</h1>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my social change project. My topic is joy. What I wanted to do through the things I wrote and created was to spread happiness and joy throughout the world. There were many ways I did this. I made this website, for example, using new skills I learned from my fellow classmate. I also made a scratch project, which will be linked below. I read articles on joy and happiness and wrote my findings, I watched speeches and other videos on joy, and lots of other things to figure out one question, how can joy and happiness change the world?</p>

                <h1>What is Joy?</h1>
                <p>What is joy, you may ask. Joy is different than happiness. Joy is an inner feeling, rather than an outward expression. Joy is a choice, while happiness is not. Finding joy could be as simple as going on a walk, or as big as getting married, for example. Certain objects bring joy to some people as well. Bubbles, rubber ducks, rainbows, etc. All these things have the same effect on our brain.</p>
